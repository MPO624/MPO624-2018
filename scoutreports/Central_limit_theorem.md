## What does this actually mean?

### If X1, X2, ..., Xn are INDEPENDENT and identically distributed  random variables with a finite mean (u) and variance (sigma**2), then as n approaches infinity, an approximation, Y, becomes:

### Converging to a normal distribution with a mean (Nu) and a variance (N*(sigma**2))


## Further simplifed: it does not matter what the underlying distribution of X is, you can  approximate much more complicated distributions such as Poisson and Gamma to be normal as long as N is assumed to be large (N > 30 is the rule). 

### You can then follow Z ~ N(0,1), using standard normal (z) tables to 'shortcut' what otherwise could be much more difficult:
