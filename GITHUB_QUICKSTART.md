# Make your space on GitHub!

1. Install the desktop client (app) ~~https://desktop.github.com/~~ 
   - For the moment you can still get the old app from https://central.github.com/mac/latest. RECOMMENDED! 
   - While you're at it, install the text editor atom https://atom.io/
   
2. Make an account on github.com (the desktop client will prompt you on launch, or you can go directly). 

3. Fork the class repo on the GitHub Web site. 

4. Connect your fork to a working copy on your local machine. To do this, open the GitHub desktop app, and find where it says **Clone an existing project from GitHub to your computer**. You will have to select the directory name on your own computer. 

   - *This folder will be special*: it will have some hidden files in there (starting with .git) to keep track of all those branches and forks and stuff. This helps you keep local verison control for yourself, and enables syncing with your Fork online. 

       - Naming is worth a lot of thought. How will all this fit into your larger intellectual life (as mapped into your computer)? For myself, I think Jupyter notebooks are a huge future, and it is nice to have them all in one folder tree. So I will use the name **(home)/Jupyter/MPO624-2018.**

* Repository "branching" concepts (and command-line names for things) are nice and clear at: https://learngitbranching.js.org/ 
         
     - git is a **minimum** set of rules needed for peers to collaborate on a thing. It's a fundamental aspect of group existence! Well worth the attention. You can do all our stuff more visually, from the desktop client (app), but the git command lines show the bare bones behind it.
